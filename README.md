Building a Custom JavaScript Toast Notification System: A Step-by-Step Guide

Create a container element in your HTML markup where the toast messages will be displayed. For example, you could create a div element with a unique ID like <div id="toast-container"></div>.

Create a function in your JavaScript code to dynamically create and display a toast message. This function should accept parameters such as the message content, the duration to display the message, and any other customization options you want to include.


In the function, create a new div element to represent the toast message. Customize the styling of this element as desired, such as its background color, font size, and position within the container.


Add the message content to the div element, either as text or as HTML markup.



Append the div element to the container element you created earlier.



Use a timer or animation to display the toast message for the specified duration, and then remove the message from the container.

Note that this is just a simple example, and you can customize your toast notification system further as needed. You may want to add more features such as animation effects, support for multiple toast messages at once, and options to customize the styling and behavior of individual messages.
